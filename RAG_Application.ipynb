            "\n",
            "We’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n",
            "\n",
            "And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n",

            "If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n",

            "\n",
            "And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \n",
            "\n",
            "Second – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \n",
            "\n",
            "If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \n",

            "\n",
